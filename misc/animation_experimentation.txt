CONCLUSION: Fade-in time is always 400ms.

=== Snaking time experiment ===

Theory: 1/3 of the approach time, for AR10 450ms / 3 = 150ms

AR 0:

yeah. 600ms is 1/3 of 1800ms, which is the approach time for AR0.

CONCLUSION: Slider snaking time is 1/3 of approach time.

Okay. CONCLUSION: Slider tick animation time is 200ms.

=== First slider tick appearance ===

Mhh. So wait.
1800ms => 700ms.
1560ms => 650ms?
450ms => 250ms

OKAY. Pretty-much conclusion: First tick appearance time (and by that, I mean start of animation) is after Approach_time / 3 + 100ms.

=== repeat arrow pulse speed ===

AR 10:

AR 0:

dif 300

CONCLUSION: Repeat arrow pulses every 300ms.

=== Repeat arrow pulse start ===
The repeat arrow begins its pulse cycle when the corresponding circle starts its fade-in.

CONCLUSION: Actually, no. Wrong. Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhm yeah slider end fade-in always takes 400ms.

=== Follow circle pulse duration ===

2875

dif 250

dif 250

CONCLUSION: Follow circle pulses for 250ms. Ah, let's say 200.

And it's independent of AR.

CONCLUSION: Hit objects fade out in 200ms.
